Name: Obedient Cat

TASK: 
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known information:
We have one file:

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Machines/Pico_CTF/Obient_Cat]
└─$ file flag   
flag: ASCII text
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Process:
Since this is a text file, let's look at it first using the cat command.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Machines/Pico_CTF/Obient_Cat]
└─$ cat flag       
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_28e8376d}

We already got the flag!
Since it was a very easy challenge, it's not surprising that we got the flag right away.
