**Hello, Friend.**
If this little phrase sounds familiar, then you probably know Mr.Robot.

I've loved technology and everything that goes with it my whole life and I've always found **cyber security** particularly interesting. So now I wanted to start with it, because currently a **new life begins** for me.

Here I will create writeups about **CTFs**:triangular_flag_on_post: and **boxes**:desktop_computer:.
I'm always open to suggestions for improvement and welcome tips to learn more about commands, programs, scripts, etc.

Thanks for being here,
stay safe, **Friend**
